<h3 align="center">App that helps future parents choose name for their baby</h3>
Project evolved from one function to whole web application. 
After writing first function with hardcoded names I wanted to improve it.
Quickly an idea of writing web app came to my mind.
First step was to implement drawing name from propositions given by user.
Second step was adding feature letting to choose name from defined categories.
Having that I came up with another concepts, all listed below. One can try to choose name by clicking the link in "Try it" section.

<h3 align="left">Features:</h3>

1. User can enter his name prepositions, then let app draw a name
2. If user have no ideas, app can draw a name for him. One just have to choose sex and name category
3. App display statistics of drawn names
4. Exporting drawn names statistics to PDF file

It takes app to load about 5 seconds.
